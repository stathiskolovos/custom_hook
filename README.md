# Lab: Fetch Data using useFetch

In this lab, you will learn how to fetch data in React using a custom hook (UseFetch) and a corresponding component (FetchData). By encapsulating data-fetching logic into reusable hooks, you can improve code maintainability. You will master React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and asynchronous operations efficiently. Additionally, you learn to dynamically render fetched data on the UI with JSX, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive components.

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Fetch data from an external API using the fetch API method within a React application
2. Implement a custom React hook (UseFetch) to encapsulate the logic to fetch data
3. Render the data retrieved from the API onto the UI and display relevant information such as name, importance, benefits, and the best time to intake for each item
